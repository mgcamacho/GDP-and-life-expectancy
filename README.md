# GDP-and-life-expectancy

### Description
This is a portfolio project based on the learning resources provided by Codecademy, that explores the relationship between life expectancy and GDP of six countries over two decades (2000-2015). The project aims to understand how economic growth and well-being are related across nations.

### Data
The data used for this project comes from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The data is in CSV format and contains the following variables:

- Country: The name of the country.
- Year: The year in which the data was recorded.
- Life expectancy at birth (years): The average number of years that a newborn is expected to live if current mortality rates continue to apply.
- GDP: The total value of goods and services produced by a country in a given year, in US dollars.

### Tools
The following tools were used for the analysis:

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for creating and sharing documents with code, text, graphics, etc.
- Pandas: Python library for data structures and operations.
- Numpy: Python library for mathematical functions and operations.
- Seaborn: Python library for statistical graphics.
- Matplotlib: Python library for two-dimensional graphics.
- Statsmodels: Python library for statistical models.

### Results
The results can be seen in life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb, which has the code, the comments and the graphs of the analysis.
